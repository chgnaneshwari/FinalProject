This project aims to create a tool for tracking daily calorie intake and providing personalized nutrition recommendations. Users will input their meals and portion sizes, and the system will calculate their total calorie consumption. The system will compare this value with recommended daily limits based on individual goals (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, or gain). The application will offer insights into the userâ€™s eating habits and suggest healthier alternatives.
